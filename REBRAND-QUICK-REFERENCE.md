# Revenue Engineering Rebrand - Quick Reference Guide

## Core Messaging Principles

### The 5-Second Rule
Every page should answer within 5 seconds:
1. What specific outcome do you deliver?
2. How much will it move the needle (40% cost reduction, 3.5x ROAS)?
3. What enterprise systems do you integrate with?

### Tone Checklist
- [ ] Active voice ("We architect" not "We offer")
- [ ] Specific metrics (not "better", use "40% faster")
- [ ] Business terms (not consumer language)
- [ ] Outcome-focused (revenue impact, not features)
- [ ] No marketing fluff or buzzwords

## Quick Decision Tree

**When rewriting any content, ask:**

1. **Is it outcome-focused?**
   - If NO → Add specific metric or business result

2. **Is it enterprise-appropriate?**
   - If NO → Replace consumer language with business terms

3. **Is it specific?**
   - If NO → Name the tool, technology, or method

4. **Does it prove expertise?**
   - If NO → Add technical detail or integration capability

5. **Would a CFO understand the value?**
   - If NO → Translate to revenue/cost impact
