## Core Messaging Framework (IMPLEMENTED)

- Value Prop: Business outcomes, not features
- Differentiator: Complete tracking infrastructure proving which dollar created which deal

### Tone Guidelines
- Active voice: "We architect" not "We offer"
- Outcome-focused: "Reduce costs by 40%" not "Improve efficiency"
- Specific terms: "Executive Dashboards" not "Reports"
