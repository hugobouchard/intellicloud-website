Adaptive design uses fixed layouts for specific breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)—multiple layouts that snap between sizes. We recommend responsive for most projects because it's easier to maintain, handles all device sizes including unusual ones, and delivers smoother experiences. Adaptive makes sense only when you need dramatically different experiences on different devices. True responsive design with mobile-first approach delivers the best ROI and maintainability."

Our responsive designs work flawlessly on all modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and mobile browsers (Safari iOS, Chrome Android). We test across the last 2 versions of each major browser covering 99.5%+ of users. If you have documented IE11 requirements, we can provide graceful degradation but strongly recommend pushing users to upgrade—maintaining IE11 costs more than the 0.5% of traffic justifies."

Result: mobile users download 70% smaller images, desktop users get high-res versions, load time reduced by 50%+ while maintaining visual quality on all devices."

Process includes: (1) Audit current site identifying all breakage points, (2) Restructure HTML to use semantic, flexible markup, (3) Rebuild CSS with fluid grids and flexible layouts, (4) Optimize JavaScript for touch interactions, (5) Implement responsive images and media, and (6) Test across all devices and browsers. Some sites are easier to retrofit than others—sites built on modern frameworks adapt faster. Very old sites (table layouts, inline styles, Flash) often cost more to retrofit than rebuild. We'll audit and recommend the most cost-effective approach."

Basic responsive design for small business site (10-15 pages) starts at $12,000 including mobile-first design, fluid layouts, and cross-device testing. Complex responsive site with custom interactions and advanced features starts at $30,000. Enterprise responsive design with extensive device testing and performance optimization starts at $50,000. Retrofitting existing site to responsive typically 40-60% of new build cost. All projects include strategy, design, development, testing, and performance optimization. ROI typically positive within 90 days through improved mobile conversion rates."

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A B2B SaaS company had a desktop-only website converting at 2.1% overall but only 0.8% on mobile (55% of traffic). Mobile experience was terrible—tiny text, forms impossible to fill on phone, demo videos wouldn't play. They tried using a mobile-detection redirect to separate m.domain.com but content was always outdated and Google penalized them for duplicate content. Mobile traffic was essentially wasted—55% of visitors getting bad experience.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We implemented true mobile-first responsive redesign: fluid grid system scaling perfectly from 320px to 4K, touch-optimized forms with proper input types and autocomplete, video player adaptive to bandwidth and screen size, responsive navigation with hamburger menu on mobile, progressive disclosure hiding secondary content on small screens, and performance optimization achieving 1.4s mobile load time down from 7.2s.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Results in 3 months:</strong> Overall conversion rate increased from 2.1% to 4.8% (129% improvement), mobile conversion rate jumped from 0.8% to 4.2% (425% improvement—mobile now performs as well as desktop), mobile bounce rate decreased from 72% to 38%, demo requests from mobile increased 340%, mobile PageSpeed score improved from 32 to 96, and maintenance time reduced by 60% (one codebase instead of two). Investment: $28,000. Additional annual revenue from improved mobile conversions: $480,000.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's the difference between responsive and adaptive design?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Responsive design uses fluid grids that smoothly scale to any screen size—one codebase adapts to all devices. Adaptive design uses fixed layouts for specific breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)—multiple layouts that snap between sizes. We recommend responsive for most projects because it's easier to maintain, handles all device sizes including unusual ones, and delivers smoother experiences. Adaptive makes sense only when you need dramatically different experiences on different devices. True responsive design with mobile-first approach delivers the best ROI and maintainability.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's included in your responsive design service?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Our responsive design includes: (1) Mobile-first design strategy and wireframes, (2) Fluid grid system with breakpoint optimization, (3) Touch-optimized interactions and gestures, (4) Cross-browser and cross-device testing, (5) Responsive image optimization and delivery, (6) Performance optimization for mobile networks, (7) Accessibility compliance across devices, and (8) Analytics setup to track device-specific metrics. Complete multi-device experience engineered for conversions, not just screen sizes.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Do you support older browsers like IE11?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">IE11 is dead (under 0.5% global usage) and Microsoft officially ended support. We don't actively develop for IE11 unless you have specific enterprise requirements. Our responsive designs work flawlessly on all modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and mobile browsers (Safari iOS, Chrome Android). We test across the last 2 versions of each major browser covering 99.5%+ of users. If you have documented IE11 requirements, we can provide graceful degradation but strongly recommend pushing users to upgrade—maintaining IE11 costs more than the 0.5% of traffic justifies.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How do you handle responsive images for performance?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">We implement advanced responsive image techniques: (1) srcset and sizes attributes to deliver different image sizes based on viewport, (2) WebP format with JPEG fallbacks for 30% smaller files, (3) Lazy loading for below-fold images, (4) Progressive JPEG encoding for faster perceived load, (5) Art direction using picture element when composition needs to change, and (6) CDN delivery with automatic optimization. Result: mobile users download 70% smaller images, desktop users get high-res versions, load time reduced by 50%+ while maintaining visual quality on all devices.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What screen sizes and devices do you test on?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">We test across comprehensive device matrix: (1) Mobile: iPhone 12/13/14/15, various Android devices (Samsung, Pixel), (2) Tablets: iPad, iPad Pro, Android tablets, (3) Desktop: 1366x768 (most common), 1920x1080, 2560x1440, ultrawide, and (4) Edge cases: small phones (320px), large desktops (4K). We use real devices plus BrowserStack for cross-device testing. We also test portrait and landscape orientations, various zoom levels, and different browser rendering engines. Your responsive design works perfectly on devices that don't even exist yet.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Can you make my existing website responsive?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Yes—we can retrofit existing desktop-only websites to be responsive. Process includes: (1) Audit current site identifying all breakage points, (2) Restructure HTML to use semantic, flexible markup, (3) Rebuild CSS with fluid grids and flexible layouts, (4) Optimize JavaScript for touch interactions, (5) Implement responsive images and media, and (6) Test across all devices and browsers. Some sites are easier to retrofit than others—sites built on modern frameworks adapt faster. Very old sites (table layouts, inline styles, Flash) often cost more to retrofit than rebuild. We'll audit and recommend the most cost-effective approach.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's your responsive design pricing?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Pricing depends on complexity and device coverage. Basic responsive design for small business site (10-15 pages) starts at $12,000 including mobile-first design, fluid layouts, and cross-device testing. Complex responsive site with custom interactions and advanced features starts at $30,000. Enterprise responsive design with extensive device testing and performance optimization starts at $50,000. Retrofitting existing site to responsive typically 40-60% of new build cost. All projects include strategy, design, development, testing, and performance optimization. ROI typically positive within 90 days through improved mobile conversion rates.</p>
