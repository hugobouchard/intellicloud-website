Single-tenant gives each customer their own dedicated instance—like separate houses. Multi-tenant is more cost-effective (shared resources), easier to maintain (one codebase to update), and faster to provision new customers (no new infrastructure). Single-tenant offers better isolation and customization but costs 5-10x more to operate. We recommend multi-tenant for 95% of SaaS businesses—it's proven at scale (Salesforce, Slack, all major SaaS use multi-tenant). Reserve single-tenant for customers with extreme compliance requirements."

We also implement separate schemas per tenant for enterprise customers requiring extra isolation. All queries are automatically scoped to the current tenant context—developers cannot accidentally query cross-tenant data. This approach is battle-tested serving millions of users across thousands of tenants with zero data leakage incidents."

Integrations: Stripe for billing, Auth0 or custom auth, SendGrid for email, Segment for analytics.

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A startup built an MVP project management tool serving 150 customers on single-tenant architecture—each customer had separate database and app instance. Infrastructure costs were $12,000/month and growing 8% per new customer. Onboarding took 3 hours of manual setup per customer, creating 2-week delays that killed deals. They couldn't pass SOC 2 audit because of inconsistent security across instances. At 200 customers they'd be losing money on infrastructure alone. Growth was blocked by architecture.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We rebuilt as proper multi-tenant SaaS platform: PostgreSQL with row-level security providing complete data isolation, automated provisioning allowing instant signup-to-active in under 60 seconds, Stripe integration with multiple pricing tiers and metered billing for storage, RESTful API with comprehensive documentation enabling customer integrations, horizontal scaling with auto-scaling infrastructure, security implementation achieving SOC 2 compliance, and admin dashboard for customer management and support.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Results in 8 months:</strong> Customer base grew from 150 to 2,400 customers (1,500% growth), infrastructure costs decreased from $12k/month to $1,800/month despite 16x more customers, onboarding time reduced from 3 hours to 60 seconds (fully automated), SOC 2 Type 2 certification achieved enabling enterprise sales, enterprise customers now 40% of revenue at 3x average contract value, and API usage grew to 50M+ requests/month with 99.97% uptime. Platform now serving 12,000+ active users with zero scaling issues. Investment: $165,000. Annual recurring revenue 18 months post-launch: $3.2M.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's the difference between multi-tenant and single-tenant SaaS architecture?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Multi-tenant architecture serves all customers from a single application instance with shared infrastructure but isolated data—like an apartment building where everyone shares utilities but has private apartments. Single-tenant gives each customer their own dedicated instance—like separate houses. Multi-tenant is more cost-effective (shared resources), easier to maintain (one codebase to update), and faster to provision new customers (no new infrastructure). Single-tenant offers better isolation and customization but costs 5-10x more to operate. We recommend multi-tenant for 95% of SaaS businesses—it's proven at scale (Salesforce, Slack, all major SaaS use multi-tenant). Reserve single-tenant for customers with extreme compliance requirements.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's included in your SaaS platform development?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Our SaaS development includes: (1) Multi-tenant architecture with proper data isolation, (2) Subscription billing and payment processing (Stripe integration), (3) User authentication, permissions, and role-based access control, (4) API-first design with comprehensive documentation, (5) Automated provisioning and onboarding flows, (6) Usage tracking and metering for billing, (7) Admin dashboard for platform management, (8) Scalability engineering for high concurrency, (9) Security implementation and compliance (SOC 2, GDPR), and (10) Monitoring, logging, and alerting. Complete SaaS platform engineered for growth, not just MVP functionality.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How do you handle data isolation in multi-tenant architecture?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">We implement defense-in-depth data isolation: (1) Database-level: tenant_id on every table with row-level security policies, (2) Application-level: middleware that enforces tenant context on every query, (3) API-level: authentication tokens scoped to specific tenants, (4) Testing: automated tests that attempt cross-tenant data access to verify isolation. We also implement separate schemas per tenant for enterprise customers requiring extra isolation. All queries are automatically scoped to the current tenant context—developers cannot accidentally query cross-tenant data. This approach is battle-tested serving millions of users across thousands of tenants with zero data leakage incidents.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How long does SaaS platform development take?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Timeline depends on complexity and feature scope. MVP with core functionality (auth, billing, basic features): 12-16 weeks. Full-featured platform with advanced capabilities: 20-28 weeks. Enterprise platform with compliance requirements: 28-36 weeks. We work in 2-week sprints with continuous delivery so you can start beta testing within 8-10 weeks even while we continue building. Most clients launch to first paying customers within 4-5 months with continuous feature additions post-launch. We prioritize features that demonstrate value and generate revenue early.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What tech stack do you use for SaaS platforms?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">We choose tech stacks based on your requirements, but our standard SaaS stack: Backend: Node.js or Python (FastAPI) for API, PostgreSQL with row-level security for database, Redis for caching and session management. Frontend: React or Vue.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling. Infrastructure: AWS or Google Cloud, Docker containers, Kubernetes for orchestration, CloudFlare for CDN and DDoS protection. Integrations: Stripe for billing, Auth0 or custom auth, SendGrid for email, Segment for analytics. This stack proven at scale, handles millions of users, and has rich ecosystem of tools and libraries. We adapt based on your team's expertise and specific requirements.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How do you ensure SaaS platforms can scale?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Scalability is architected from day one: (1) Stateless application servers that can scale horizontally, (2) Database read replicas and connection pooling, (3) Redis caching for frequently accessed data, (4) Async job processing for heavy operations (reports, email), (5) CDN for static assets and API responses, (6) Database query optimization and indexing, (7) Load testing under realistic conditions, and (8) Auto-scaling infrastructure that adds capacity during traffic spikes. We design for 100x your launch scale so you never scramble to keep up with growth. Many clients handle 10,000+ concurrent users on infrastructure costing under $2,000/month.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's your SaaS platform development pricing?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Pricing depends on complexity, feature scope, and scale requirements. MVP SaaS platform with core features (auth, billing, basic functionality) starts at $75,000 for 12-16 weeks of development. Full-featured platform with advanced capabilities starts at $150,000 for 20-28 weeks. Enterprise platform with compliance, advanced security, and white-label capabilities starts at $300,000 for 28-36 weeks. Ongoing maintenance and feature development typically 15-25% of initial investment annually. All projects include architecture, development, security implementation, testing, deployment, and launch support. ROI typically positive within 12-18 months through recurring subscription revenue.</p>
