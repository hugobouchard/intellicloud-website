Custom Shopify development delivers 3-4x better conversion rates because every element is designed for your business—product page layouts optimized for your catalog, checkout flow engineered for your customer journey, and performance tuned for your traffic patterns. If you're doing $50k+/month or planning to scale, custom development pays for itself within 60-90 days through improved conversion rates."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Regular Shopify works well up to about $100k/month. Beyond that, Shopify Plus delivers significant benefits: checkout customization (regular Shopify checkout is locked), wholesale channel for B2B, automation workflows, dedicated support, and unlimited staff accounts. Plus also removes transaction fees if using external payment gateways. We recommend Plus for stores doing $100k+/month or with complex B2B requirements. The $2,000/month Plus cost is easily justified by checkout optimization alone."

Shopify Plus implementation with custom checkout and B2B functionality: 10-16 weeks. We work in sprints so you see progress weekly and can launch an MVP version earlier while we continue optimization. Most clients go live with core functionality within 6-8 weeks."

Migration includes: product catalog transfer with all variants and images, customer data and order history migration, URL redirects to preserve SEO, payment and shipping setup, app integration replacement, and design improvement during migration. Most migrations complete within 6-8 weeks with zero downtime. We run old and new stores in parallel until you're 100% confident."

Common use cases: custom pricing logic, specialized product configurators, ERP/POS integrations, subscription management, B2B portals, and advanced inventory workflows. Custom apps can be private (just your store) or public (published to Shopify App Store). Development typically takes 6-10 weeks depending on complexity. We also customize and extend existing apps when needed."

Advanced Shopify Plus implementations with custom checkout and B2B functionality start at $25,000. Custom app development starts at $15,000. Monthly optimization and support packages start at $1,500/month. All projects include strategy, development, testing, and launch support. ROI typically positive within 60-90 days through improved conversion rates."

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A fashion retailer doing $120k/month on WooCommerce was hitting platform limitations. Site crashed during traffic spikes, checkout was slow and clunky (3.8% conversion rate), mobile experience was terrible (52% of traffic, 28% of revenue), and they couldn't implement the wholesale channel needed for B2B expansion. WooCommerce plugins were conflicting, causing constant maintenance headaches.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We migrated to Shopify Plus with complete redesign: custom theme optimized for their fashion catalog with lifestyle imagery and quick-add functionality, streamlined checkout with Apple Pay and Shop Pay integration, separate wholesale channel with tiered pricing for B2B customers, performance optimization achieving 1.6s load time, and abandoned cart recovery flows that automatically recovered 18% of abandoned carts.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Results in 6 months:</strong> Conversion rate increased from 3.8% to 8.2% (116% improvement), revenue grew from $120k/month to $340k/month, mobile conversion rate tripled from 2.1% to 6.4%, wholesale channel generated $85k additional monthly revenue, and zero site downtime during Black Friday handling 4.2x normal traffic. Total investment: $28,000. Additional revenue in first 6 months: $1.32M.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Should I use a purchased Shopify theme or custom development?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Purchased themes work for starting out but limit growth. They're not optimized for your specific products, customer behavior, or conversion funnel. Custom Shopify development delivers 3-4x better conversion rates because every element is designed for your business—product page layouts optimized for your catalog, checkout flow engineered for your customer journey, and performance tuned for your traffic patterns. If you're doing $50k+/month or planning to scale, custom development pays for itself within 60-90 days through improved conversion rates.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's included in your Shopify development service?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Our Shopify development includes: (1) Custom theme development optimized for conversions, (2) Checkout flow optimization and abandoned cart recovery, (3) Performance optimization for sub-2-second load times, (4) Custom app integration or development, (5) Product page optimization with A/B testing, (6) Mobile commerce optimization, (7) Technical SEO implementation, and (8) Analytics and conversion tracking setup. Complete Shopify store engineered for revenue, not just looking pretty.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Do I need Shopify Plus or is regular Shopify enough?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Regular Shopify works well up to about $100k/month. Beyond that, Shopify Plus delivers significant benefits: checkout customization (regular Shopify checkout is locked), wholesale channel for B2B, automation workflows, dedicated support, and unlimited staff accounts. Plus also removes transaction fees if using external payment gateways. We recommend Plus for stores doing $100k+/month or with complex B2B requirements. The $2,000/month Plus cost is easily justified by checkout optimization alone.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How long does custom Shopify development take?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Timeline depends on complexity. Simple custom theme with standard features: 4-6 weeks. Complex store with custom apps, advanced filtering, and integrations: 8-12 weeks. Shopify Plus implementation with custom checkout and B2B functionality: 10-16 weeks. We work in sprints so you see progress weekly and can launch an MVP version earlier while we continue optimization. Most clients go live with core functionality within 6-8 weeks.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Can you migrate my existing store to Shopify?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Yes—we've migrated hundreds of stores from WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, and custom platforms to Shopify. Migration includes: product catalog transfer with all variants and images, customer data and order history migration, URL redirects to preserve SEO, payment and shipping setup, app integration replacement, and design improvement during migration. Most migrations complete within 6-8 weeks with zero downtime. We run old and new stores in parallel until you're 100% confident.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Do you develop custom Shopify apps?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Yes—when existing apps don't fit your requirements, we build custom Shopify apps. Common use cases: custom pricing logic, specialized product configurators, ERP/POS integrations, subscription management, B2B portals, and advanced inventory workflows. Custom apps can be private (just your store) or public (published to Shopify App Store). Development typically takes 6-10 weeks depending on complexity. We also customize and extend existing apps when needed.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's your Shopify development pricing?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Pricing depends on complexity and requirements. Basic custom theme development starts at $8,500 for a conversion-optimized store with standard features. Advanced Shopify Plus implementations with custom checkout and B2B functionality start at $25,000. Custom app development starts at $15,000. Monthly optimization and support packages start at $1,500/month. All projects include strategy, development, testing, and launch support. ROI typically positive within 60-90 days through improved conversion rates.</p>
