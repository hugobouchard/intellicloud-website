          "text": "Choose custom eCommerce when off-the-shelf platforms can't handle your business model: complex B2B pricing with customer-specific rates, unique checkout workflows that platforms don't support, deep ERP/PIM integration requiring real-time bidirectional sync, subscription models with complex billing logic, or multi-tenant marketplaces. Generally recommended for businesses doing $5M+ annually with requirements that force you to hack platforms with workarounds. Custom platforms cost more upfront but eliminate the technical debt and limitations that eventually force a replatform anyway."

Complex B2B platform with ERP integration and custom workflows: 20-28 weeks. Enterprise marketplace with multi-tenant architecture: 28-40 weeks.

Common stacks: Headless commerce with React/Next.js frontend and Node.js/Python backend, or traditional monolith with Laravel/Django for simpler requirements. For enterprise scale: microservices architecture with containerized deployment. Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, Elasticsearch for search, Redis for caching. Cloud: AWS or Azure with auto-scaling. All selections optimized for your traffic patterns, team capabilities, and long-term maintainability."

We integrate with ERPs (SAP, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics), PIMs (Akeneo, Pimcore), WMS systems, accounting platforms (QuickBooks, Xero), CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), and custom internal systems. Integration includes real-time inventory sync, automated order routing, customer data synchronization, and bidirectional product catalog updates. We architect integration to prevent data conflicts and ensure consistency across all systems."

We use cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling, database optimization with proper indexing and caching strategies, CDN for static assets, microservices architecture for high-traffic components, queue-based processing for heavy operations, and load testing before launch. Our platforms regularly handle Black Friday traffic at 10x normal levels without slowdown. We architect for your 3-year growth projections, not just current needs."

          "text": "Investment depends on complexity and features. Basic custom B2C platform starts at $75,000 for headless architecture with standard features. Advanced B2B platform with ERP integration and custom workflows starts at $150,000. Enterprise marketplace with multi-tenant architecture starts at $250,000. Most projects also include ongoing support at $5,000-15,000/month. While higher upfront cost than Shopify, custom platforms eliminate platform fees (2-3% of revenue), remove growth limitations, and typically deliver 3-5 year ROI through improved efficiency and capabilities."

          <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">CASE STUDY: Industrial B2B Distributor Custom Platform</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">An industrial distributor doing $12M annually on WooCommerce was drowning in platform limitations. They needed customer-specific pricing for 800+ B2B customers, complex product configurator for custom orders, real-time inventory sync with NetSuite ERP, quote management with multi-level approval workflows, and separate portals for distributors vs direct buyers. WooCommerce plugins were breaking constantly, customer-specific pricing was maintained in spreadsheets, and orders required manual entry into NetSuite—team spending 40 hours/week on manual data sync.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We built custom headless eCommerce platform: API-first architecture with React frontend and Node.js backend, real-time NetSuite integration for inventory/pricing/orders, sophisticated B2B portal with account hierarchies and approval workflows, product configurator for custom orders with real-time pricing, separate distributor portal with volume pricing and drop-ship capabilities, and admin dashboard with advanced analytics and workflow management.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Results in 12 months:</strong> Revenue grew from $12M to $28M (133% growth) as digital channel removed friction, manual order processing reduced from 40 hours/week to 2 hours/week saving $78k annually, quote-to-order conversion rate improved from 23% to 64%, distributor network expanded from 45 to 120 partners enabled by self-service portal, and system handled peak load of 12x average traffic during industry trade show. Total investment: $185,000. ROI positive within 8 months through labor savings and revenue growth.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">When should I choose custom eCommerce over Shopify or WooCommerce?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Choose custom eCommerce when off-the-shelf platforms can't handle your business model: complex B2B pricing with customer-specific rates, unique checkout workflows that platforms don't support, deep ERP/PIM integration requiring real-time bidirectional sync, subscription models with complex billing logic, or multi-tenant marketplaces. Generally recommended for businesses doing $5M+ annually with requirements that force you to hack platforms with workarounds. Custom platforms cost more upfront but eliminate the technical debt and limitations that eventually force a replatform anyway.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's included in custom eCommerce development?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Custom eCommerce development includes: (1) Headless architecture with API-first design, (2) Custom pricing logic and checkout workflows, (3) Product catalog with unlimited attributes and variations, (4) Real-time ERP/inventory integration, (5) B2B portal with quote management and approval workflows, (6) Payment gateway integration with fraud detection, (7) Multi-channel selling (web, mobile, marketplaces), (8) Admin dashboard with advanced analytics, and (9) Scalable cloud infrastructure. Everything built specifically for your business model.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How long does custom eCommerce development take?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Timeline depends on complexity and scope. Basic custom platform with standard B2C features: 12-16 weeks. Complex B2B platform with ERP integration and custom workflows: 20-28 weeks. Enterprise marketplace with multi-tenant architecture: 28-40 weeks. We work in sprints with incremental deliveries so you see progress every 2 weeks. Most clients launch MVP within 16-20 weeks and continue enhancement post-launch.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What technology stack do you use for custom eCommerce?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">We select technology based on your requirements, not our preferences. Common stacks: Headless commerce with React/Next.js frontend and Node.js/Python backend, or traditional monolith with Laravel/Django for simpler requirements. For enterprise scale: microservices architecture with containerized deployment. Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, Elasticsearch for search, Redis for caching. Cloud: AWS or Azure with auto-scaling. All selections optimized for your traffic patterns, team capabilities, and long-term maintainability.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Can you integrate with our existing ERP or business systems?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Yes—deep business system integration is a core strength. We integrate with ERPs (SAP, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics), PIMs (Akeneo, Pimcore), WMS systems, accounting platforms (QuickBooks, Xero), CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), and custom internal systems. Integration includes real-time inventory sync, automated order routing, customer data synchronization, and bidirectional product catalog updates. We architect integration to prevent data conflicts and ensure consistency across all systems.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How do you ensure the platform can scale?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Scalability is architected from day one, not bolted on later. We use cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling, database optimization with proper indexing and caching strategies, CDN for static assets, microservices architecture for high-traffic components, queue-based processing for heavy operations, and load testing before launch. Our platforms regularly handle Black Friday traffic at 10x normal levels without slowdown. We architect for your 3-year growth projections, not just current needs.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's the investment for custom eCommerce development?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Investment depends on complexity and features. Basic custom B2C platform starts at $75,000 for headless architecture with standard features. Advanced B2B platform with ERP integration and custom workflows starts at $150,000. Enterprise marketplace with multi-tenant architecture starts at $250,000. Most projects also include ongoing support at $5,000-15,000/month. While higher upfront cost than Shopify, custom platforms eliminate platform fees (2-3% of revenue), remove growth limitations, and typically deliver 3-5 year ROI through improved efficiency and capabilities.</p>
