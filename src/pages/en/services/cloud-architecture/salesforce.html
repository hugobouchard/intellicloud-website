Sales teams are forced into workflows that don't make sense, adoption suffers, and data quality becomes unreliable. Without proper customization, integration, and change management, Salesforce becomes an expensive database that nobody trusts. Successful implementations require understanding your specific sales process and configuring Salesforce to support it—not forcing your team to adapt to out-of-box settings."

Mid-market implementations with integrations and customizations take 10-16 weeks. Enterprise implementations with complex workflows, multiple integrations, and change management take 16-24 weeks.

We integrate Salesforce with your marketing automation (HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot), email (Gmail, Outlook), accounting/ERP (QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP), customer support (Zendesk, Intercom), phone systems, and custom internal tools. Native integrations where available, API connections where needed. The goal is a single source of truth where data flows automatically between systems—no manual entry, no data silos."

Our approach: (1) Configure Salesforce to match existing workflows rather than forcing change, (2) Automate data entry wherever possible so sales teams spend less time on admin, (3) Hands-on training with real scenarios, not generic tutorials, (4) Show immediate value—better pipeline visibility, faster quote generation, clearer commission tracking, (5) Executive buy-in and accountability, (6) Champions program with power users who support their peers. We measure adoption weekly and iterate quickly. Average client adoption rate: 89% active usage within 60 days."

After that, ongoing support packages start at $2,500/month and include system administration, new feature development, integration maintenance, user training for new hires, and quarterly optimization reviews.

Small team implementations (5-15 users) start at $15,000 and include basic configuration, 1-2 integrations, and training. Mid-market implementations (15-50 users) start at $35,000 with custom workflows, multiple integrations, and change management. Enterprise implementations (50+ users) start at $75,000 with complex automation, data migration, and dedicated project management. All packages include 90 days post-launch support.

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">A B2B SaaS company with 25-person sales team had implemented Salesforce themselves 18 months prior. Adoption was 34%, data quality was terrible (duplicate accounts, inconsistent data entry), and executives didn't trust pipeline reports. Sales ops spent 15 hours per week cleaning data manually. The VP of Sales couldn't forecast accurately and was making hiring decisions blind.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We reimplemented Salesforce properly: mapped their entire sales process and configured custom stages, objects, and fields to match; automated lead routing by geography and company size; integrated with HubSpot for marketing attribution and Intercom for support ticket visibility; built executive dashboards showing real-time pipeline health and forecast accuracy; created automated workflows for quote generation and approval; trained the team with hands-on workshops using real deals. Made it easy to use correctly and hard to use wrong.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700"><strong>Results in 90 days:</strong> Adoption increased from 34% to 91%, sales cycle shortened from 67 days to 39 days (42% faster), forecast accuracy improved to 94% (executives trust the numbers), sales ops time on manual cleanup dropped from 15 hours/week to 2 hours/week, pipeline visibility increased 67%, win rate up 18% (better qualification data). Total investment: $42,000. Added annual revenue from faster sales cycles and better forecasting: $2.4M.</p>

        <h2 class="heading heading-2 mb-12 text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="space-y-6">
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Why do most Salesforce implementations fail to deliver ROI?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Most Salesforce implementations fail because they're configured as generic CRMs that don't match the actual sales process. Sales teams are forced into workflows that don't make sense, adoption suffers, and data quality becomes unreliable. Without proper customization, integration, and change management, Salesforce becomes an expensive database that nobody trusts. Successful implementations require understanding your specific sales process and configuring Salesforce to support it—not forcing your team to adapt to out-of-box settings.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's included in your Salesforce implementation service?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Our Salesforce implementation includes: (1) Sales process mapping and requirements gathering, (2) Custom object and field configuration matching your data model, (3) Workflow automation for repetitive tasks, (4) Integration with marketing automation, ERP, and other existing systems, (5) Custom dashboards and reports executives actually use, (6) Sales team training with hands-on workshops, (7) Data migration from legacy systems, (8) Change management and adoption support, and (9) 90-day post-launch optimization. Complete implementation, not just setup.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How long does Salesforce implementation take?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Implementation timeline depends on complexity. Basic implementations for small teams (5-15 users) take 6-8 weeks. Mid-market implementations with integrations and customizations take 10-16 weeks. Enterprise implementations with complex workflows, multiple integrations, and change management take 16-24 weeks. We prioritize getting core functionality live quickly, then iterate with advanced features. Sales teams see productivity benefits within weeks of launch, not months of waiting for a perfect system.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Can you integrate Salesforce with our existing tools?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Yes—integration is critical for adoption and ROI. We integrate Salesforce with your marketing automation (HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot), email (Gmail, Outlook), accounting/ERP (QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP), customer support (Zendesk, Intercom), phone systems, and custom internal tools. Native integrations where available, API connections where needed. The goal is a single source of truth where data flows automatically between systems—no manual entry, no data silos.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">How do you ensure sales team adoption?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Adoption is where most implementations fail. Our approach: (1) Configure Salesforce to match existing workflows rather than forcing change, (2) Automate data entry wherever possible so sales teams spend less time on admin, (3) Hands-on training with real scenarios, not generic tutorials, (4) Show immediate value—better pipeline visibility, faster quote generation, clearer commission tracking, (5) Executive buy-in and accountability, (6) Champions program with power users who support their peers. We measure adoption weekly and iterate quickly. Average client adoption rate: 89% active usage within 60 days.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">Do you provide ongoing support after implementation?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Yes—Salesforce needs continuous optimization as your sales process evolves. We provide 90 days of included post-launch support to address issues and refine configuration based on real usage. After that, ongoing support packages start at $2,500/month and include system administration, new feature development, integration maintenance, user training for new hires, and quarterly optimization reviews. Many clients start with full implementation then transition to retainer-based support for long-term partnership.</p>

          <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200">
            <h3 class="font-semibold mb-2">What's your pricing for Salesforce implementation?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Implementation pricing depends on team size and complexity. Small team implementations (5-15 users) start at $15,000 and include basic configuration, 1-2 integrations, and training. Mid-market implementations (15-50 users) start at $35,000 with custom workflows, multiple integrations, and change management. Enterprise implementations (50+ users) start at $75,000 with complex automation, data migration, and dedicated project management. All packages include 90 days post-launch support. Pricing is fixed-fee based on detailed requirements—no hourly billing uncertainty.</p>
